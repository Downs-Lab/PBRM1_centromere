Custom pipeline for analysing mapping data (e.g. CUT&RUN.salt or ChIP-seq) - extracting uniquely mapping reads and enriched k-mer analysis 
(based on pipeline used in Smith, Owen K et al. “Identification and characterization of centromeric sequences in Xenopus laevis.” Genome research vol. 31,6 (2021): 958-967. doi:10.1101/gr.267781.120)

1. System requirements 

1.1 Software dependencies and operating systems 

Software dependencies: 

The analysis pipeline was performed using the CentOS8 linux distribution platform (based on Redhat Enterprise Linux Operating System)
The analysis pipeline can be run on a computer with the linux operating system


1.2 Required non-standard hardware 

The analysis pipeline was performed on a high performance computer with 1248x Intel Xeon Platinum 8260(Cascade Lake) @ 2.40GHz cores with minimum 8GB/core
The analysis pipeline requires a minimum of 8 cores with minimum 16Gb/core 


2. Installation guide

For instructions on installing and loading required packages, see file 01_Prepare_directories_and_files.sh


3. Instructions for use 

For setup instructions refer to the file 01_Prepare_directories_and_files.sh

Use of conda environments created:
unique_reads is used for 02_trim_fastqc.sh to 16_cen_peaks.sh
identify_kmers is used for 18_Filter_out_spike_in.sh to 23_mv_control_kmers.sh
enriched_kmers is used for 24_enriched_kmers_9IgG_LH.sh, 25_overlap_2reps_enriched_kmers.sh, 29_kmer_specific_groups.sh
kmer_analysis is used for 26_enrich_kmer_fa.sh to 28_cen_pivot.sh
 
For unique read mapping follow 02_trim_fastqc.sh to 17_specific_groups.sh in numerical order 
(within 'Unique_read_mapping' folder, including 7b_mark_remove_dups.sh)
For kmer analysis: 
Output files generated from steps up to 12_index_stats.sh are required
Follow 18_Filter_out_spike_in.sh to 29_kmer_specific_groups.sh (within 'k-mer_analysis_pipeline' folder)
